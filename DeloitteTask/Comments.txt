The algorithm creates a 2D Float array by reading a TSV file. All the values in a single line are added to the array. If the file contains 100 lines and each line contains 5 numbers, then a [100][5] array is created. Max number of lines is 2000 which can be changed.
There is a special case for points in two dimensions where the running time is O(nlogn).
For all other dimensions, the running time is O(n^2m) where n is the number of lines and m is the number of dimensions.
To use, the address of the file to be read should be put into the source code.
The program assumes there are no blank lines, all values are separated by tabs and the points are 2 dimensional or higher.
